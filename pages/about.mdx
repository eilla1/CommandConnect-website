# Command Connect

Command Connect is a virtual mentorship program hosted by Command Tech to help link female & nonbinary individuals who are interested in **technology** with experienced professionals in an array of related fields.

### Our Mission & Vision

Statistics show that female and non-binary individuals are still widely **underrepresented** in vast fields of technology. Here at Command Tech, our mission is to improve those inequities through the application of **intersectional mentorship**.

#### What is intersectional mentorship?

Intersectional Mentorship is the act of "supporting marginalized groups to not only navigate and survive the system...but work to change these institutions" 

_- Nadia E. Brown and Celeste Montoya_

### Available Pathways

#### The Networking Track

This resembles a traditional mentorship course. Mentees will have opportunities to have Q&A sessions with their mentors

#### The Project Track

Our newest addition to the program offers a platform for mentees to be guided by mentors to collectively work on a project of the pair's choice

### What sets us apart?

Besides our pursuit of intersectional mentorship, our new approach consists of transparency, convenience, and **YOUR** voice being heard!

The newly improved pairing process is done in three simple steps:

1. mentees fill out a form declaring their aspirations and what they specifically hope to gain
   - ie a soft skill, technical skill, or a certain project
2. mentors personally choose who they believe they could help the most
   - link with mentees' information provided
   - **filtering** options will be available to help in the decision process
3. mentors submit their choices (and we'll handle the rest)

### Time Commitment Estimate

Both tracks will last **2 months**. We suggest weekly or bi-weekly meetings with your mentors based on your schedules and pathway.
